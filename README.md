# Agentic AI Research Assistant

Agentic AI Research Assistant is a modular AI software system that demonstrates how large language models, reasoning agents, and external tools can be orchestrated to solve research tasks. The project is built with Python and the OpenAI Responses API and is designed to evolve from a simple local RAG system into a production-style multi-agent research platform.

Version 1 focuses on local document retrieval and tool-assisted reasoning. Future versions will expand the system with semantic search, PubMed integration, vector databases, and multi-tool orchestration.

## Motivation

Modern AI applications require more than a single LLM call. They often combine reasoning, external tools, retrieval systems, and modular software architecture.

This project explores those concepts by incrementally building an extensible agentic AI research assistant.

---

## Learning Objectives

This project is designed to demonstrate and explore:

- Agentic AI workflows
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Tool selection and orchestration
- Software architecture for AI applications
- Object-oriented design in Python

---

## Current Capabilities

* OpenAI Responses API integration
* Modular agent architecture
* ReasoningAgent for tool selection
* ResearchAgent for workflow coordination
* Calculator tool
* Local document search
* Basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
* Environment-based configuration using `.env`
* Clean, extensible project structure

## Example

**Question**

```
What do my notes say about RAG?
```

**Answer**

```
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves LLM applications by allowing the model to answer questions using external documents instead of relying only on its training data.
```
